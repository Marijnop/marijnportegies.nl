# A Letter to the Reader {.text-center .mb-4}

::: {.lede}
Dear reader,
:::

This site is still taking shape.

In time, it will hold essays on economics, philosophy, politics, and culture, as well as small data-scientific plug-ins and experiments.

It exists mostly for myself — a way to keep writing, researching, and staying curious.

For now, it contains only my contact information. The rest will grow in its own time.
