## Principles

- *Be precise.* Prefer mechanisms to slogans.  
- *Be fair.* Represent opposing views in their strongest form.  
- *Be useful.* Write with the readerâ€™s future in mind.  
- *Be revisable.* Admit error quickly; reward evidence.

## Background

Iâ€™m currently based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, studying and working or seeking to work at the intersection of **econometrics, policy, data and philosophy** in a changing world.
